Hierarchical structure of the Executor framework in Java:
=>Executor (interface)
          -->ExecutorService (interface)
                      -->  AbstractExecutorService (abstract class)
                                    --> ThreadPoolExecutor (concrete Class)
                                    --> ForkJoinPool (concrete Class)
                      -->  ScheduledExecutorService (interface)
                                    --> ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor (concrete class, extends ThreadPoolExecutor)
=>Executors (utility class with static factory methods)
          -->Provides factory methods like:
                      -->  newFixedThreadPool()
                      --> newCachedThreadPool()
                      --> newSingleThreadExecutor()
                      --> newScheduledThreadPool()
                      --> newWorkStealingPool()

Executors: Objects that encapsulate thread management (creation, scheduling, reuse, shutdown) so the rest of your application only needs to focus on defining tasks.
