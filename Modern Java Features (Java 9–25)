======================================================================================! Java 9 !====================================================================================
=> More Concise Try-With-Resources Statements:
	-> Before Java 7: Developers had to use a finally block to manually close resources. This was verbose and error-prone, as forgetting to close a resource could lead to memory leaks.
	-> Java 7: Introduced try-with-resources, allowing resources to be declared directly in the try statement. The resource is automatically closed when execution exits the try block, eliminating the need for a finally block.
	-> Java 9: Enhanced try-with-resources by allowing effectively final resources declared outside the try block. This is useful when a resource needs to be initialized earlier but still benefits from automatic closing.
	-> Example Code link: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/TryWithResourcesExample.java

=> @SafeVarargs Annotation Allowed on Private Instance Methods (Java 7)
	-> Purpose: The @SafeVarargs annotation is used to suppress warnings about potentially unsafe operations when using varargs with generics.
	-> Before Java 7: The annotation could only be applied to static or final methods.
	-> Java 7: Introduced @SafeVarargs for static and final methods to indicate that the method does not perform unsafe operations on its varargs parameters, making code safer and cleaner.
	-> Java 9+: The annotation was extended to allow private instance methods as well. This means private methods with varargs can now safely use @SafeVarargs to suppress warnings.
		-> Without @SafeVarargs, Java will give a “possible heap pollution” warning when passing generic varargs.
		-> Cannot Be Applied to Non-Private, Non-Final Instance Methods: Only static, final, or private instance methods are allowed.
		-> Safe Usage Requirement: The method must not modify or store the varargs array in an unsafe way.
		-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/SafeVarargsDemo.java 

=> Diamond Syntax with Anonymous Inner Classes (Java 7):
	-> Before Java 7, when you wrote generics, you had to repeat the type on both sides: List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(); // old way
	-> Java 7 introduced diamond syntax (<>) to reduce redundancy: List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); // Java 7
		-> The compiler automatically infers the type String from the left-hand side.
	-> But In Java 7, diamond <> cannot be used with anonymous inner classes. Java 9 allows diamond <> even for anonymous inner classes, if the type can be inferred:
		-> The compiler figures out that it’s ArrayList<String> from the left-hand side (List<String>).
		-> Code Example DiamondAnonymousJava7: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/DiamondAnonymousJava7.java
		-> Code Example DiamondAnonymousJava9: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/DiamondAnonymousJava9.java

=> Underscore Character Not Legal Name (Java 9)
	-> In Java, an underscore '_' was historically allowed as an identifier (variable name, method name, etc.).
	-> Java 9 **disallows using a single underscore '_' as an identifier**.
	-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/UnderscoreExample.java

=> Support for Private Interface Methods (Java 9)
	-> Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods (no body).
	-> Java 8 introduced: Default methods (methods with body), Static methods
	-> Problem in Java 8: Default methods often had **duplicate code** across multiple default methods. No way to **reuse code internally** within the interface.
	-> Java 9 allows **private methods in interfaces**. Private methods can be used **only inside the interface** to reduce code duplication. They **cannot be accessed** from implementing classes.
	-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java9/Car.java

======================================================================================! Java 10-11 !====================================================================================

=> Local Variable Type: var
  -> Explicit Typing: In explicit typing, the programmer specifies the data type of a variable at the time of its declaration.
  -> Inferred Typing: In inferred typing, the programming language determines the data type of a variable based on the value assigned to it.
  -> Update: In JDK 10 and later, you can declare local variables with non-null initializers with the var identifier(var is a reserved type name, not a keyword), which can help you write code that’s easier to read.
    -> var data = null; // ❌ Compilation Error: Cannot infer type for local variable initialized to 'null'
  -> USECASE:
    -> Local variable with initializer: In traditional Java, you must explicitly declare the type of a variable. Using var, the compiler infers the type from the initializer, making the code cleaner.
        -> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java10_11/TypeInferenceExample.java
    -> Enhance For-Loops: In for-each loops, var can simplify type declaration. In traditional, you can also use var for the index variable.
        -> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java10_11/ForEachWithVarExample.java
    -> Try-With-Resources: Try-With-Resources automatically closes resources (like files, streams) after use, eliminating the need for explicit finally blocks. Java 10 allows using 'var' inside the try-with-resources declaration, making the code more concise while still strongly typed.
        -> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java10_11/TryWithResourcesExample.java
    -> Lambda Expressions: Starting with JDK 11, var can be used for parameters in lambda expression. This ensures consistency between lambda parameters and local variable declarations. In other words, just as local variables can use var for the compiler to infer their type, lambda parameters can also use var to let the compiler deduce their type based on context.
        -> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java10_11/LambdaVarExample.java
    
  -> Guidelines and Restrictions: 
    -> Consistency: You cannot mix var and explicitly typed parameters or inferred types in lambda expressions:
    -> Readability: While var simplifies code, excessive use can make code harder to understand if the inferred type isn't immediately clear.
    -> Avoid Ambiguity: Use var only when the initializer provides enough context to understand the type

=> .repeat(n): This is a new method introduced in Java 11 and is very handy for repeating strings without loops.
  -> Method Signature: "public String repeat(int count)"
    -> count → the number of times the string should be repeated.
    -> Returns → a new string consisting of the original string repeated count times.
    -> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java10_11/StringRepeatExample.java


==========================================================================! Java 14: Switch Expressions and Statements !======================================================================
=> Switch Expressions: 
	-> Switch expressions are a modern and safer way to write switch statements in Java.
	-> They reduce mistakes like accidental fall-through and make the code more readable.
	-> In a switch expression, each case can directly return a value using the -> syntax.
	-> This is a key difference from traditional switch statements, which cannot return values directly from a case.

=> Fall-Through 
	-> In traditional switch statements, if you forget to add a break statement, the program will continue executing the next case unexpectedly. This is called fall-through.
	-> Switch expressions use case L -> labels, which eliminate the need for break statements.
	-> Each case executes directly, and no further cases are executed unless explicitly defined.
	-> This prevents unintended execution and makes the code safer and clearer.
	-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java14/SwitchEnhancementDemo.java

=> How values are returned in traditional switch statement and a switch expression in Java using the return keyword.?
	-> In a traditional switch statement, you can't directly return a value from a case. Instead, you need to store the value in a variable, and later return that value from the method using the return keyword.
	-> In a switch expression, you can directly return a value from each case using the -> syntax. There's no need to store the value in a variable beforehand.
	-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java14/SwitchReturnDemo.java

=> Yield Keyword:
	-> The yield keyword is used when you want to execute multiple statements in a case block and still return a value.
	-> Introduced in Java 12, it addresses the need for returning values from a block of statements inside a switch expression.
	-> Without yield, the compiler cannot determine what value to return when a case contains more than one statement (like printing, calculations, or method calls).
	-> yield explicitly specifies the value to be returned from the case block.
	-> Code Example: https://github.com/Vinay8386/core_Java/blob/main/Java14/SwitchYieldDemo.java

=> Difference Between Switch statements (regular switch) and switch expressions?
	-> Switch statements use case L: and can have fall-through, meaning you need to use break to prevent running into the next case.
	-> Switch expressions use case L -> and automatically return a value for that case, making your code cleaner and easier to read.
			
=> Summary: 
	-> Before Java 12: No yield keyword. Traditional switch statements had case L: labels with optional break statements and no direct value returns from cases.
	-> From Java 12 onwards: Switch expressions were introduced with the case L -> label, and the yield keyword was added to allow returning values from case blocks.
		

==========================================================================! Java 15 : Text Block Introduction (Multiline String Literals) !======================================================================
=> Text Block: New way to represent String in Java. A text block starts with three double-quote characters (""") followed by a line terminator (newline).
=> Purpose: Simplify working with multiline strings by minimizing the required syntax, making the code more readable and less cluttered. Text blocks make multiline strings easier to read by removing clutter like +, \n, and quotation marks.
=> How text blocks handle new-line and white-space?
	-> Final New Line Handling: If the closing """ is on a new line, a newline character (\n) is added at the end of the string. To remove the final newline, place the closing """ right after the last line. Use a backslash (\) at the end of a line to suppress the implicit newline
	-> Handling Indentation (Incidental White Space): Incidental white space refers to the unnecessary leading spaces (indentation) in a text block that match the least-indented line. The Java compiler automatically removes these spaces to avoid affecting the content of the text block. Example:
	-> Disabling Incidental White Space Stripping: By default, Java text blocks automatically remove incidental white spaces (leading spaces) that align with the least-indented line in the block. This makes it easier to write neatly indented text blocks without worrying about unintentional leading spaces affecting your output. 
		-> However, if you don't want Java to remove those spaces, you can disable the automatic stripping of incidental white spaces. You can disable incidental white space stripping by placing the closing delimiter (""") on a new line without any indentation (i.e., at the first column of the line).
	-> Adding Indentation Explicitly: Use the indent(int n) method to add consistent indentation to all lines
	-> Text blocks include newlines by default: Each line break in a text block is translated to \n in the resulting string.
	-> Whitespace handling is critical: Ensure that the strings you compare are formatted identically by removing or adjusting spaces and newlines.
	-> String methods like .replace() and .strip(): Use these to normalize the strings for comparison when dealing with text blocks.
	-> Usecase: Perfect for embedding code or structured data. Great for JSON, HTML, XML, and code snippets. Before the text block when using traditional strings in Java, you had to:
		-> 	Escape double quotes (") with a backslash (\").
		->	Manually add line breaks (\n) to represent multiline text.
		-> But now If you're working with code snippets, HTML, JSON, or any structured text, text blocks save time and make your code more readable.
	-> Trailing White Space in Java Text Blocks: The Java compiler removes trailing white spaces in text blocks to ensure consistency and avoid invisible changes caused by text editors. If trailing white space is required, use one of these techniques to preserve trailing white space:
	-> Character Substitution: Replace a placeholder character with a space after the text block.
	-> Character Fence: Use a marker (e.g., |) and replace it after defining the text block.
	-> Octal Escape Sequence: Use \040 to represent spaces.
	-> \s Escape Sequence: Use \s to denote spaces.

What Is Pattern Matching for instanceof?
-> Pattern Matching for instanceof is a language feature introduced in Java 16 that simplifies type checking and casting. Traditionally, when you want to check if an object is of a certain type and then use it as that type, you write code that explicitly checks with instanceof and then casts the object.

Pattern Matching allows you to combine these two steps into one concise operation. When you use instanceof with a pattern, it not only tests the object's type but also automatically casts it to a variable of that type if the test succeeds. This makes the code shorter, safer, and easier to read.

Before Java 16	After Java 16
Object obj = "Hello, Java!";	Object obj = "Hello, Java!";
	
if (obj instanceof String) {	if (obj instanceof String str) {
    // You need to cast explicitly	    // No need to cast explicitly
    String str = (String) obj;	    System.out.println(str.toUpperCase());
    System.out.println(str.toUpperCase());	}
}
	Object obj = 123;
	
	if (obj instanceof Integer i) {
	    System.out.println(i + " is an Integer");
	} else if (obj instanceof String s) {
	    System.out.println(s + " is a String");
	} else {
	    System.out.println("Unknown type");
	}



Record Class: 
https://openjdk.org/jeps/395

Records are a special kind of class introduced in Java 16 that are designed to hold immutable data in a concise and clear manner.Instead of writing lots of boilerplate code, records let you define a class by just declaring its data fields, and Java automatically provides much of the usual code for you.

In Java, when you create a class to store data, you often end up writing a lot of boilerplate code—constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods. Records aim to eliminate this repetitive code, allowing you to focus on the data itself.

Basic Record Definition:

// Define a record called Point with two components: x and y	• The record declaration creates a class with private final fields x and y.
record Point(int x, int y) {}	• It automatically creates a constructor Point(int x, int y) to initialize these fields.
	• It automatically creates getter methods x() and y().
public class Main {	• The toString() method prints the fields in a readable way.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Point object
        Point p = new Point(5, 10);

        // Use the automatically created getter methods
        System.out.println("x = " + p.x());  // prints: x = 5
        System.out.println("y = " + p.y());  // prints: y = 10

        // Use the automatically created toString() method
        System.out.println(p);  // prints: Point[x=5, y=10]
    }
}
record Person(String name, int age) {}	• equals() compares two records by their component values.
	• hashCode() returns consistent hash values for equal records.
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
        Person p2 = new Person("Alice", 25);
        Person p3 = new Person("Bob", 30);

        // equals() method compares the content of records
        System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));  // prints: true
        System.out.println(p1.equals(p3));  // prints: false

        // hashCode() is consistent with equals()
        System.out.println(p1.hashCode() == p2.hashCode());  // prints: true
    }
}
record Rectangle(int width, int height) {	You can still add your own methods inside a record:
    // Custom method to calculate area
    public int area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(4, 5);
        System.out.println("Area: " + rect.area());  // prints: Area: 20
    }
}

	• Records save you from writing boilerplate code.
	• They are immutable data carriers with built-in support for common operations.
	• You can still add custom behavior if needed.

Constructors in Record Classes:
When you write a record like this: record Point(int x, int y) {}
Java automatically gives you:
You didn’t write all that, but Java automatically generates it for you.	// What the compiler "sees"
	record Point(int x, int y) {
	    private final int x;
	    private final int y;
	
	    public int x() { return x; }
	    public int y() { return y; }
	
	    public Point(int x, int y) {
	        this.x = x;
	        this.y = y;
	    }
	
	    public boolean equals(Object o) { ... }
	    public int hashCode() { ... }
	    public String toString() { ... }
	}
	
If you want to validate or normalize data, you can write your own constructor.	record Range(int lo, int hi) {
You don't declare parameters — they're implied from the record header.	    // This is a compact constructor
Java still assigns this.lo = lo and this.hi = hi automatically.	    Range {
	        if (lo > hi) {
	            throw new IllegalArgumentException("lo cannot be greater than hi");
	        }
	    }
	}
Custom Normalization (Make data simpler)	record Rational(int num, int denom) {
	    Rational {
	        int gcd = gcd(num, denom);
	        num /= gcd;
	        denom /= gcd;
	
	        // Must assign normalized values explicitly
	        this.num = num;
	        this.denom = denom;
	    }
	
	    // Helper method to find GCD
	    static int gcd(int a, int b) {
	        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
	    }
	}

Rules & Restrictions for Record Classes:

Restriction	Explanation
❌ Cannot extend any class	All records implicitly extend java.lang.Record.
❌ Cannot be abstract or open	Records are implicitly final.
❌ Cannot declare extra fields	You can only have the fields listed in the record header.
❌ No instance initializers	You cannot write {} blocks inside to initialize data.
❌ No native methods	Records should only depend on their own data.
✅ Can implement interfaces	You can still add behavior by implementing interfaces.
✅ Can define static fields/methods	Same as in normal classes.
✅ Can define instance methods	You can add custom logic.
✅ Can be nested or generic	You can do: record Box<T>(T value) {}
✅ Supports annotations	You can annotate fields, methods, parameters, etc.
✅ Serializable	Records are serializable, but custom serialization methods are not allowed.

Local record classes: 
A local record class is a record declared inside a method, just like a local class. It’s useful when you need a simple data container only within that method, to group some values together temporarily.
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Merchant {
    private final String name;

    Merchant(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Just for printing
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    static double computeSales(Merchant merchant, int month) {
        // Dummy computation for example
        return Math.random() * 1000;
    }

    public static List<Merchant> findTopMerchants(List<Merchant> merchants, int month) {
        // Local record class inside method
        record MerchantSales(Merchant merchant, double sales) {}

        return merchants.stream()
            .map(merchant -> new MerchantSales(merchant, computeSales(merchant, month)))
            .sorted((m1, m2) -> Double.compare(m2.sales(), m1.sales()))
            .map(MerchantSales::merchant)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Merchant> merchants = List.of(new Merchant("Alice"), new Merchant("Bob"), new Merchant("Carol"));

        List<Merchant> topMerchants = findTopMerchants(merchants, 9);
        System.out.println(topMerchants);
    }
}
• The MerchantSales record is declared inside the findTopMerchants method.
• It groups a Merchant and their sales amount (double sales).
• The stream creates MerchantSales instances for each merchant with their sales.
• Then it sorts merchants by sales in descending order.
• Finally, it extracts the merchants in sorted order and returns the list.
Important points about Local Records:
	• They behave like nested record classes but are declared inside methods.
	• They are implicitly static:
		○ So, they cannot access variables or parameters from the enclosing method directly.
		○ This is different from normal local classes, which can access method variables (if those variables are final or effectively final).
	• Because they're static, local records don't carry any hidden references to the enclosing instance.


Local Enum Classes and Local Interfaces
	• Just like local record classes, local enum classes and local interfaces can be declared inside methods.
	• These local enums and interfaces are implicitly static, just like nested enums and interfaces at the class level.
	• This means they don’t hold a reference to the enclosing instance or method variables.
	• This addition is mainly for consistency with local record classes and nested enums/interfaces.

Static Members of Inner Classes — Relaxed Restriction
	• Previously, Java didn’t allow an inner class (a non-static nested class) to declare static members — except for constant variables.
	• This rule meant inner classes couldn’t have members like nested record classes, since records are implicitly static.
	• Now, this restriction is relaxed:
		○ Inner classes can declare static members, including nested record classes.
		○ This gives more flexibility in organizing code inside inner classes.
		

Annotations on record components

For each component, Java automatically creates:
	1. A private final field to hold the value.
	2. A public accessor method to get the value.
	3. A parameter in the canonical constructor to set the value when creating an instance.

Before records, to annotate fields, constructor parameters, and getters, you had to write:	public final class Employee {
	    private final String name;
	    private final int id;
	    private final double salary;
	
	    public Employee(String name, int id, double salary) {
	        this.name = name;
	        this.id = id;
	        this.salary = salary;
	    }
	
	    public String name() { return name; }
	    public int id() { return id; }
	    public double salary() { return salary; }
	}
After Record	public record Employee(String name, int id, double salary) { }
Now, what about Annotations on these components?	import javax.validation.constraints.Min;
Let's say you want to add some annotations — for example, you want to mark the id field as a database column and also mark the salary to indicate a certain validation rule.	
	public record Employee(
With records, you just write the annotation once on the component, and Java takes care of applying it everywhere it matters.	    String name,
	
	    @Column(name = "employee_id") 
	    int id, 
	
	    @Min(0) 
	    double salary
	) { }
This will result (behind the scenes) in something like:	public final class Employee {
	    @Column(name = "employee_id")
	    private final int id;
	
	    @Min(0)
	    private final double salary;
	
	    public Employee(String name, 
	                    @Column(name = "employee_id") int id, 
	                    @Min(0) double salary) {
	        this.id = id;
	        this.salary = salary;
	        this.name = name;
	    }
	
	    @Column(name = "employee_id")
	    public int id() { return id; }
	
	    @Min(0)
	    public double salary() { return salary; }
	
	    public String name() { return name; }
	}

Key idea:
	• All record classes in Java automatically extend java.lang.Record.
	• java.lang.Record is automatically imported by default (like all classes in java.lang), so you don’t need to import it explicitly.
	• This means when you declare a record like record Employee(...) {}, it actually extends java.lang.Record behind the scenes.
